# java-class-diagram-CRUD
This is a small project in which I use classes to store client-submitted data of pets, clients and medicines. The user has the ability to read the information and store new information accordingly.

# DEVELOPMENT DATA:
1. This small project was created based on a workshop that I found interesting to work on (https://ibb.co/rbts0JD).
2. Users are able to do CRUD operations.
3. Time taken: 2 days (with no prior knowledge of Java).

# NOTES:
1. It's not an advanced project. In fact, I only built it to test my problem-solving capabilities in Java. 
2. Consequently, this project lacks in-deep optimization and it's not exploits-free/bug-proof.
