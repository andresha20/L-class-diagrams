# java-class-diagram-CRUD
This is a small project in which I use classes to store client-submitted data of pets, clients and medicines. The user has the ability to read the information and store new information accordingly.

# DEVELOPMENT DATA:
1. This small project was created based on a workshop that I found interesting to work on (https://ibb.co/rbts0JD).
2. Users are able to do CRUD operations.
